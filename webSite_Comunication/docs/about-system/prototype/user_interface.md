# User Interface
### Application

The user interface will be used by the participants. Participants will be able to access their personal data and top up their account with money. This money will enable purchases within the event without the need to exchange and hold physical money.

Lead participants, in this case associated with the scouting event, who are responsible for younger scouts, will be able to receive notifications if one of their charges is admitted to the infirmary.
